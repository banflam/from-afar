Future thoughts: - Honestly, need to be able to hand my phone to anybody and get them started with sending letters to other users asap, AND it needs to look really good while this happens (polished) - Sign-up still does not work fully. - Need it to LOOK GOOD and for that need to learn design to make it look good. - Ability to block users - Ability to report letters - Switch modes -- flat delay instead of distance-based - Creation of avatars for each person (important feature!!!) - Addition of languages for each person, and any corresponding suport for them - Last logged-in date visibility - Filters for choosing users from /users - Email notification whenever: - Someone has sent a letter to the user (who has sent it and from where) - Letter delivered (who has sent it and from where)
