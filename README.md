Future thoughts:
    - Ability to block users
    - Ability to report letters
    - Switch modes -- flat delay instead of distance-based
    - Creation of avatars for each person (important feature!!!)
    - Addition of languages for each person, and any corresponding suport for them
    - Last logged-in date visibility
    - Filters for choosing users from /users
    - Email notification whenever:
        - Someone has sent a letter to the user (who has sent it and from where)
        - Letter delivered (who has sent it and from where)
