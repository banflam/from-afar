Slogan: From Afar. Friends at heart. 

Idea: send letters and make lifelong connections without the hassle. The time taken for delivery depends on geographical distance.

# MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT: 

Q. WHAT IS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WITH WHICH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LAUNCH THIS PROJECT AND SHOW IT TO THE WORLD?

When visiting the website, the user should be able to log in or create an account.

When visiting the website, the user should also get some (very basic) information about the entire project -- what it is, how it works, why bother creating an account and using it, who this is for and who this is not for, etc.

Website looks nice, no need for anything too fancy but it should be pleasant even though if it is just simple.

## USER ACCOUNT FLOW (ACCOUNT CREATION)

Probably will just use AWS Cognito for authentication. Put the AWS skills in practice but also it's really convenient with the federated identity stuff built-in etc.

But to be able to move forward and activate their account and send/receive messages, the user must provide a few details:

- Address (on a city basis, not on a specific house/location basis to ensure privacy).
- username
- gender (male/female/other)
- Preferred languages (just selection, no ranking of the languages) --> WILL DO THIS IN THE FUTURE.
- Self-description (minimum character requirement)
- Last logged in date (so that people can avoid inactive users and have a better experience that way).

## AFTER LOGGING IN / AFTER CREATING AN ACCOUNT

- Inbox: a place for the user to see the letters that have arrived so they can read them, and letters that are still incoming (days/hours/minutes left until arrival listed)
    - Sending user is listed.
    - Three tabs: incoming, unread, read

- New users page: a place seeing all other users so that the user can strike up a new correspondence as they wish.
    - This will NOT be the default tab, the inbox will be the default tab since the aim is to foster deeper and more meaningul connections, not for shallow spamming of different people.
