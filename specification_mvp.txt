# MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT: 

Q. WHAT IS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WITH WHICH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LAUNCH THIS PROJECT AND SHOW IT TO THE WORLD?

When visiting the website, the user should be able to log in or create an account.

When visiting the website, the user should also get some (very basic) information about the entire project -- what it is, how it works, why bother creating an account and using it, who this is for and who this is not for, etc.

Website looks nice, no need for anything too fancy but it should be pleasant even though if it is just simple.
